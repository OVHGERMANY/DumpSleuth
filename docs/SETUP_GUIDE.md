# Setup Guide for Memory Dump Analysis Tool

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with analyzing memory dump files.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Python Installation
- **Download Python 3.7+** from [python.org](https://python.org)
- **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing: `python --version`

### 2. Administrator Access
- Some analysis features may require running as Administrator
- Right-click Command Prompt and select "Run as Administrator"

## Quick Setup (Easy Way)

### Option A: Using the Batch File (Recommended)
1. **Double-click** `quick_start.bat`
2. **Select option 4** to install dependencies
3. **Wait** for installation to complete
4. **Select option 1** to run automated analysis

### Option B: Manual Setup
1. **Open Command Prompt** in this folder
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run analysis**: `python dump_analyzer.py`

## First Analysis

### For Beginners (Recommended)
```bash
python dump_analyzer.py
```
This will automatically analyze your dump and create a report.

### For Manual Exploration
```bash
python manual_analysis.py
```
This provides an interactive interface to explore the dump.

### For String Analysis
```bash
python string_extractor.py
```
This extracts all readable text from the dump.

## What You'll Get

After running the analysis, check these folders:
- **`analysis_results/`** - Contains detailed reports
- **Generated files** - Various `.md` and `.txt` files with findings

## Understanding Your Results

### Automated Analysis Report
The automated analysis will create a comprehensive report showing:
- **File Information**: Basic details about your dump
- **Process Information**: What was running when it crashed
- **Extracted Strings**: Readable text found in memory
- **Pattern Matches**: Interesting data patterns
- **Memory Structure**: Technical details about the dump format

### Key Things to Look For
1. **Error Messages**: Look for clues about what went wrong
2. **File Paths**: See what files the process was accessing
3. **Network Data**: Check for any network communication
4. **Loaded Modules**: See what DLLs were in use
5. **System Information**: OS version, architecture, etc.

## Understanding Different Dump Types

Your dump file could be from various sources:
- **Application crashes**: When a program stops working
- **System crashes**: Blue screen dumps
- **Process dumps**: Manual memory captures
- **Service crashes**: Background service failures

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Permission denied" errors
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Check if antivirus is blocking files

### "File not found" errors
- Make sure the `.dmp` file is in the same folder as the scripts
- Check the file isn't corrupted or still being written to

### Python not recognized
- Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
- Or use full path: `C:\Python39\python.exe dump_analyzer.py`

## Dump File Context

Common sources of dump files:
- **Application crashes**: Look for error messages in the analysis
- **Driver issues**: Check loaded modules and drivers
- **Memory corruption**: Look for suspicious patterns
- **Service failures**: Check for service-related errors

## Important Notes

- **Educational Purpose**: This tool is for understanding crashes
- **Privacy**: Some dumps may contain sensitive information
- **Backup**: Keep a copy of the original dump file

## Quick Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Use automated analysis first
2. **Read Everything**: The reports contain lots of useful info
3. **Look for Patterns**: Error messages, file paths, network data
4. **Use String Search**: Look for specific terms like "error", "config"
5. **Check Timestamps**: When did things happen?
6. **Cross-Reference**: Compare with other dumps if you have them

## Next Steps

After your first analysis:
1. **Read the generated report** carefully
2. **Try manual analysis** for deeper exploration
3. **Search for specific strings** that interest you
4. **Check the WinDbg commands** file for advanced analysis
5. **Experiment** with different tools in the project
